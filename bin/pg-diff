# pg-diff calculates the difference between two tables in a postgres database
# It is only as smart as
# 1. The diff utility
# 2. The query you give it

# That is, you need to give it a query that will return results in a predictable order.
# The utility takes the data source's URIs as the first and second positional arguments.
# The query is passed as the third positional argument.
# pg-diff will then use psql to execute the query against the respective data sources
# and pipe the results to diff

# If a second query wasn't provided, just use the first query against both data sources
